# Git Labs By Tariq Abuwashtan

## Git-Lab1: Local [Add, Commit, Log]

In Git-Lab1, I learned the basics of Git, including how to add, commit, and log changes. I created a Git repository, added files to it, committed changes, and viewed the commit history using Git Bash or a terminal.

## Git-Lab2: Local [Branches and Merging]

Git-Lab2 introduced me to branching and merging in Git. I learned how to create branches, switch between them, merge branches, and resolve conflicts. This lab also gave me hands-on experience with the main and master branches.

## Git-Lab3: GitHub Remotely

In Git-Lab3, I worked with remote repositories on GitHub. I set up a remote repository, pushed changes from my local repository to GitHub, and synced changes between my local and remote repositories. This lab provided valuable insights into GitHub's remote features.
